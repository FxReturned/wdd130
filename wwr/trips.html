            <h3>Hearth of the Marañon</h3>
            <div class="history">
                <p>The Marañón River is one of the most important water sources in Peru and a key Amazon tributary. With its source at the Nevado de Yapura glacier high up in the Andes mountains, the Marañón runs northwest through Peru along the eastern base of the Andes before it turns eastwards to flow into the Amazon plains. The Marañón meets the Ucayali River and together they form the Amazon River.                </p>
                <img src="images/maranon2.jpeg" alt="HEART OF THE MARAÑON">
                <p>The river runs through 10 distinct regions of Peru. Almost 14% of the Peruvian population lives in these regions, and they include Andean peasants, indigenous Amazon peoples, riparian populations, as well as urban communities. Hundreds of thousands of people depend on the Marañón River for their livelihood.</p>
